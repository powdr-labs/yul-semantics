# YulSemantics.Observation

**Frame-boundary observation for the EVM dialect.**

The `Step` judgment (`YulSemantics.BigStep`) is shared between the top-level frame and every
sub-frame, so — by design — it does *not* itself roll back the storage/transient/log/balance/
selfdestruct effects that a frame accumulated before it halted. A callee's rollback is applied by
`finishCall` when control returns to the caller; the **top-level** frame has no such caller, so its
rollback is applied here, at the *observation* boundary.

`EVM.committedState st0 st'` (see `YulSemantics.Dialect.EVM`) is that boundary map: it commits `st'`
on a normal/`stop`/`return`/`selfdestruct` halt and rolls everything back to `st0` (keeping only the
outcome marker and exposed return data) on a `revert`/`invalid`/`invalidMemoryAccess`/
`staticViolation` halt. This
file lifts it to whole-program runs (`RunCommitted`) and proves the payoff the raw exact-state
semantics cannot: a **dead store before a revert is observationally invisible**.

## What `EquivStmt`/`Run` alone cannot see

`EquivStmt`/`EquivBlock` compare the *entire* `Step` state exactly. Under them,
`{ sstore(0,1); revert(0,0) }` and `{ revert(0,0) }` are **not** equivalent: the first leaves
`storage[0] = 1` in the raw halt state, the second does not. That is faithful to `Step`, but it is
*not* what an EVM caller observes — a reverted frame discards its storage write. `committedState`
restores that observation, and `deadStore_revert_obs_eq` proves the two programs are equal *as
observed*.

/-- **The general theorem.** From every *non-static* initial state `st0`, the dead-store program and
the bare revert have identical observed (committed) runs. In particular the shadowed `sstore(0, 1)`
is invisible at the frame boundary — the raw exact-state relations (`EquivBlock`, which compare the
full `Step` state) cannot prove this, because they see the un-rolled-back storage write. Proven
relationally via whole-program determinism (`EVM.run_det`), quantified over all non-static `st0`.

The `st0.env.static = false` hypothesis is essential and faithful: under a `STATICCALL` context the
two programs genuinely differ — `sstore` itself halts with `.staticViolation` (exceptional), so the
dead-store program observes a `.staticViolation` halt while the bare revert observes `.revert`. -/

/-! ### Concrete demonstration

The raw run keeps the dead write (`storage[0] = 1`); the committed observation rolls it back
(`storage[0] = 0`, as in the initial state). -/
